function [trend, cyclic, noise] = bkfilter(y,p,q,k)
% Baxter-King filtering of multiple time series
%
% USAGE:
%   [TREND,CYCLIC,NOISE] = bkfilter(Y,P,Q,K)
%
% INPUTS:
%   Y      - A T by K matrix of data to be filtered.
%   P      - Number of periods to use in the higher frequency filter (e.g. 6 for quarterly data).
%              Must be at least 1.
%   Q      - Number of periods to use in the lower frequency filter (e.g. 32 for quarterly data). Q
%              can be inf, in which case the low pass filter is a 2K+1 moving average.
%   K      - [OPTIONAL] Number of points to use in the finite approximation bandpass filter.  The
%              default value is 12.  The filter throws away the first  and last K points.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   TREND  - A T by K matrix containing the filtered trend.  The first and last K points equal Y.
%   CYCLIC - A T by K matrix containing the filtered cyclic component. The first and last K points are 0.
%   NOISE  - A T by K matrix containing the filtered noise component.  The first and last K points are 0.
%
% COMMENTS:
%   The noise component is simply the original data minus the trend and cyclic component, NOISE = Y
%   - TREND - CYCLIC where the trend is produced by the low pasf filter and the cyclic component is
%   produced by the difference of the high pass filter and the low pass filter.  The recommended
%   values of P and Q are 6 and 32 or 40 for quarterly data, or 18 and 96 or 120 for monthly data.
%   Setting Q=P produces a single bandpass filer and the cyclic component will be 0.
%
% EXAMPLES:
%   Load US GDP data
%       load GDP
%   Standard BK Filter with periods of 6 and 32
%       [trend, cyclic] = bkfilter(log(GDP),6,32)
%   BK Filter for low pass filtering only at 40 period, CYCLIC will be 0
%       [trend, cyclic] = bkfilter(log(GDP),40,40)
%   BK Filter using a 2-sided 20 point approximation
%       trend = bkfilter(log(GDP),6,32,20)
