function ll = composite_likelihood(S,data,indices)
% Computes the negative of the composite normal loglikelihood (bivariate) for a K-dimensional array
%
% USAGE:
%   [LL] = composite_likelihood(S,DATA,INDICES)
%
% INPUTS:
%   S       - K by K covariance matrix
%   DATA    - Either a K by K matrix (e.g. outer-produces) or a 1 by K vector (e.g. returns)
%   INDICES - Q by 2 array of indices to use when computing the composite likleihood
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   LL      - Composite likelihood
% 
% COMMENTS:
%  This is a helper function for various multivariate GARCH models. A MEX file version of this file 
%  is available which provides a large speed-up.
%
