function phi = r2phi(R)
% Transformation of a correlation matrix to a set of angles in [0,pi]
%
% USAGE:
%  [PHI] = r2phi(R)
%
% INPUTS:
%   R   - A K by K correlation matrix
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   PHI - K(K-1)/2 vector of values in [0,2*pi]
%
% COMMENTS:
%   See phi2r for information about the transformation from Z to R.

% FIXME : It is necessary to invert both cos and sin to identify where in 0, 2pi the angle is
